Matters Lab is ready to meet the growing Web3 community in Bogotá at [Devcon](https://devcon.org/) !

In partnership with [RadicalxChange](https://www.radicalxchange.org/), we will be presenting at **[Schelling Point](https://schellingpoint.gitcoin.co/)**, **Plurality Zone on October 10th, 2PM.** [Guo Liu,](https://twitter.com/_GuoLiu) CTO of Matters Lab will deliver a panel talk together with [Kevin Owocki](https://twitter.com/owocki?s=20&t=QU8UGd5MU4NYALHEoD1lyA) from [supermodular.xyz](http://supermodular.xyz/), [Christine Vandevoorde](https://twitter.com/TinaVandev) and [Aaron Soskin](https://twitter.com/AaronSoskin) from [govrn.io](http://govrn.io/) . We are thrilled to discuss our experience in Building Plural Tech, and the progress of running a decentralized, self-governed network of creators on Matters ecosystem.

Meanwhile, we are honored to be selected as the finalist of **TECH4DEMOCRACY: BOGOTÁ VENTURE DAY competition,** for Web3 organizations and entrepreneurs who develop democracy-affirming technologies to pitch at the live competition, where **[Glen Weyl](https://twitter.com/glenweyl)** and **[Vitalik Buterin](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin)** will give keynote speeches.

[Tech4Democracy](https://ieconnects.ie.edu/click?linkid=5580fb53-f832-4e7f-9718-e05a42ea159f) is a global initiative by IE University, in partnership with the U.S. Department of State, which is also a great opportunity of exposure to investors, access to mentorship community and technical guidance. The Bogotá Venture Day will feature fireside chats on how technology can contribute to the promotion of democratic values worldwide.

[Matters Lab](http://matters-lab.io/) being the massively popular Web3 social media ecosystem redefining the creator economy, we would be thrilled to share our initiatives using decentralization tools to protect digital rights and designing a self-governing system. We will announce our visions for building the next generation of social media based on a curation market.

For all Web3 users, builders, creators, investors and evangelists, if you will be around Devcon next week, come visit us at the Schelling Point and Tech4Democracy, or any corners in Bogotá.

> DevCon takes place in Oct 11th-14th, at Agora Bogotá Convention Center. It is an intensive introduction for new Ethereum explorers, a global family reunion for those already a part of our ecosystem, and a source of energy and creativity for all.
